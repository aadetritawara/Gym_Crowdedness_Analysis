# Gym Crowdedness Analysis
In this analysis, I identify the factors that contribute most to crowdedness at a university gym and build a crowdedness prediction model

Some of the most important features for predicting gym crowdedness included the time of day (with the busiest times being around 5 p.m. and later), whether it is during the semester (more crowds during the semester), which semester it is (summer saw the least crowds), and the temperature (extremely cold temperatures were associated with fewer crowds).

Going to the gym early in the morning (at around 6 a.m.) seems like the best time to go year-round.

My prediction model was off by about 4-6 people.
